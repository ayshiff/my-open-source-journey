## Introduction



### Project description

When you want to deploy something in the cloud you probably need tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, CI pipelines, the AWS CLI...

Backstage is a platform that **unifies** all your infrastructure tooling, services, documentation with a single UI.   
It gives you an uniform overview of all your services. It also lets you create easily new ressources such as a new backend service.

Backstage was created by **Spotify** but is now hosted by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as a Sandbox level project.

For more informations about Backstage you can find it <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage"><Highlight color="#25c2a0">here</Highlight></a>.


### Context

To understand a little bit more about the initial issue you need to understand what TechDocs is.

Techdocs is a docs-like-code solution build into Backstage.
This means you can write your documentation in Markdown files which live next to your code.

*Today, it is one of the core products in Spotifyâ€™s developer experience offering with 2,400+ documentation sites and 1,000+ engineers using it daily.* ***backstage.io***

You can read more about TechDocs announcement <a href="https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs"><Highlight color="#25c2a0">here</Highlight></a>.

### Current behavior

To render the documentation, TechDocs uses the generated static files.   
In the "recommended" setup you need to add a cloud storage providers like `Google GCS`, `AWS S3`, etc.

Currently only `Google GCS` is supported by TechDocs, the goal of the issue was to implement AWS S3 as TechDocs external storage to store and read generated documentation sites.

**Added a new `awsS3` publisher**

```ts title="packages/techdocs-common/src/stages/publish/awsS3.ts"
export class AwsS3Publish implements PublisherBase {
  static fromConfig(config: Config, logger: Logger): PublisherBase {
    /**
     *  Instantiate our aws S3 client with credentials and
     *  region from the environement variables
     */
    const storageClient = new aws.S3({
      credentials: { accessKeyId, secretAccessKey },
      ...(region && { region }),
    });

    return new AwsS3Publish(storageClient, bucketName, logger);
  }

  constructor(
    private readonly storageClient: aws.S3,
    private readonly bucketName: string,
    private readonly logger: Logger,
  ) {
    this.storageClient = storageClient;
    this.bucketName = bucketName;
    this.logger = logger;
  }

  /**
   * Upload all the files from the generated `directory` to the S3 bucket.
   * Directory structure used in the bucket is - entityNamespace/entityKind/entityName/index.html
   */
  publish({ entity, directory }: PublishRequest): Promise<void> {
  }

  fetchTechDocsMetadata(entityName: EntityName): Promise<string> {
  }

  /**
   * Express route middleware to serve static files on a route in techdocs-backend.
   */
  docsRouter(): express.Handler {

  }

  /**
   * A helper function which checks if index.html of an Entity's docs site is available. This
   * can be used to verify if there are any pre-generated docs available to serve.
   */
  async hasDocsBeenGenerated(entity: Entity): Promise<boolean> {

  }
}
```

**Added tests and mocks for the publisher**

```ts title="packages/techdocs-common/src/stages/publish/publish.test.ts"
// ...
describe('fetchTechDocsMetadata', () => {
   it('should return tech docs metadata', async () => {
    const entityNameMock = {
      name: 'name',
      namespace: '/namespace',
      kind: 'kind',
    };
    const entityRootDir = `${entityNameMock.namespace}/${entityNameMock.kind}/${entityNameMock.name}`;

    mockFs({
      [entityRootDir]: {
        'techdocs_metadata.json': 'file-content',
      },
    });

    expect(await publisher.fetchTechDocsMetadata(entityNameMock)).toBe(
      'file-content',
    );
    mockFs.restore();
   });
});
// ...
```

```ts title="packages/techdocs-common/__mocks__/aws-sdk.ts"
export class S3 {
  private readonly options;

  constructor(options: S3Types.ClientConfiguration) {
    this.options = options;
  }

  headObject({ Key }: { Key: string }) {
    return {
      promise: () => this.checkFileExists(Key),
    };
  }

  getObject({ Key }: { Key: string }) {
    return {
      promise: () => this.checkFileExists(Key),
      createReadStream: () => {
        const emitter = new EventEmitter();
        process.nextTick(() => {
          if (fs.existsSync(Key)) {
            emitter.emit('data', Buffer.from(fs.readFileSync(Key)));
          } else {
            emitter.emit(
              'error',
              new Error(`The file ${Key} doest not exist !`),
            );
          }
          emitter.emit('end');
        });
        return emitter;
      },
    };
  }

  checkFileExists(Key: string) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      if (fs.existsSync(Key)) {
        resolve('');
      } else {
        reject({ message: 'The object doest not exist !' });
      }
    });
  }

  headBucket() {
    // ...
  }

  upload() {
    // ...
  }
}

export default {
  S3,
};
```
**Added steps about how to use AWS S3 in TechDocs**

**Updates config reference documentation**

```py {4-10} title="docs/features/techdocs/configuration.md"
# Required when techdocs.publisher.type is set to 'awsS3'. Skip otherwise.
awsS3:
  # An API key is required to write to a storage bucket.
  credentials:
    accessKeyId:
      $env: TECHDOCS_AWSS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID_CREDENTIAL
    secretAccessKey:
      $env: TECHDOCS_AWSS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_CREDENTIAL
  region:
    $env: AWSS3_REGION
  # AWS S3 Bucket Name
  bucketName: 'techdocs-storage',
```

## Takeaway

### Problems encountered

Someone in the comments suggested using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-sdk-javascript-version-3-generally-available/"><Highlight color="#25c2a0">AWS JavaScript SDK v3</Highlight></a> as it has first-class TypeScript support.
The issue was that there was a problem with Typescript that was going to be fixed in a <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/pull/1812"><Highlight color="#25c2a0">PR</Highlight></a>.   
So I had to wait until the fix was merged to bump the aws sdk version.
### What did I learn ?
