When you want to deploy something in the cloud you probably need tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, CI pipelines, the AWS CLI...

Backstage is a platform that **unifies** all your infrastructure tooling, services, documentation with a single UI.   
It gives you an uniform overview of all your services. It also lets you create easily new ressources such as a new backend service.

Backstage was created by **Spotify** but is now hosted by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** as a Sandbox level project.

For more information about Backstage you can find it <a href="https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage"><Highlight color="#203666">here</Highlight></a>.
