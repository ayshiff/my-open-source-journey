export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>{children}</span> );

The concept is simple, each week (surely be Wednesdays) I choose a **contribution** to Open Source that I made during the week that I find quite complete and particularly interesting to present to you.   
This contribution will be in the form of a <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Pull Request</Highlight>.

I will share with you an article which will be in the form below.

### Pull-Request reference

A badge will indicate the **Pull-Request link** (on GitHub) and another badge will indicate the **type of contribution** (feature, bug fix ...)

## Introduction
### Project description

I will put here a brief **description** of the project to which the contribution is made.   
Understanding, playing with and familiarizing yourself with the project is important when contributing to an Open Source repository.
The purpose of this step is to make you understand the usefulness of the project and to provide you with an introductory context.

### Context

This step will be a continuation of the first one, it will allow you to understand in more detail the context in which the contribution takes place.


## Current Behavior - *actual state*

This step will give you an overview of the current state (if there is one) and the desired state.   
It will allow you to understand from a functional point of view what we expect this contribution to achieve.
It will recall the outcome statement and add information you will need to have to understand the article.

## The solution - *expected state*

This step will surely be the most important.   
I will explain my reasoning to you, I will show you certain pieces of code. I will try to be as clear as possible so that you can broadly understand the work I have done.

## Takeaway
### Problem encountered

Here I will show you some issues (if there were any) that I may have encountered while resolving the issue. I will present these problems to you with a little perspective to show you how I was able to learn from these problems and find solutions.

### What did I learn ?

For me this step is one of the most important.
One of the main motivation that drives me to contribute to Open Source is to learn new things. I will therefore share here the things that I was able to learn by making this contribution.
